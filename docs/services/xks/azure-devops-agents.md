Instead of using the default agent in azure we use a VMSS (Virtual machine scale set)

To configure azure agent we need to run a few steps in a specific order.

- In Governance add hub & azpagent
- Configure & run packer, which generates a vm image
- hub with the correct packer file defined
- core with "peering_config" defined

## Governance

First you need to update your governance template. It should include a definition for hub & azpagent.

It should look something like this:

```.tfvars
  {
     common_name                = "hub",
    delegate_aks               = false,
    delegate_key_vault         = true,
    delegate_service_endpoint  = false,
    delegate_service_principal = false,
    lock_resource_group        = false,
    tags = {
      "description" = "Used for main dns"
    }
  },
  {
    common_name                = "azpagent",
    delegate_aks               = false,
    delegate_key_vault         = true,
    delegate_service_endpoint  = false,
    delegate_service_principal = true,
    lock_resource_group        = false,
    tags = {
      "description" = "Azure Pipelines Agent"
    }
  },

```

## Setup packer repo

First we need to create a vm image and we utilize [packer](https://www.packer.io/), here you can find a template for [packer](https://github.com/XenitAB/packer-templates).

### Build packer

Now import the job and in azure devops and run it.

The job will take about 40 minutes.

### Terraform configure packer image

You should now be able to see a vm image in your resource group.

Grab the name of the agent and add to your hub terraform config.

```shell
# Assuming that you don't have any other image this RG.
az image list -o json --query '[0].name'
```

In my case it's called azp-agent-2021-04-09T08-18-30Z.

## Configure Azure devops

To be able to communicate with the VMSS we need to configure a Service connection.

You will find service connection under a random project within azure devops.

To setup the service connection you need to get a secret generated by terraform.

```shell
# Assuming that you are connected to the correct subscription
az keyvault secret show --vault-name kv-prod-we-core-1307 --name sp-rg-xks-prod-azpagent-contributor -o tsv --query value
```

### configure Service connections

To create a new Service connection from Azure Devops:

Project settings -> Service connections -> New service connection -> Azure Resource Manager -> Service principal (manual)

{"clientId":"12345","clientSecret":"SoMuchSecret","subscriptionId":"sub-id","tenantId":"tenant-id"}

- Subscription Id = subscriptionId
- Service Principal Id = clientId
- Service principal key = clientSecret
- Tenant ID = tenantId
- Service connection name = random-name

### Setup Agent Pool

Still in Azure devops under project settings.

Agent pools -> Add Pool -> Pick VMSS from dropdown

<img alt="Agent image" src={useBaseUrl("img/agents/agent_pool.png")} />

### Azure Devops Billing

Configure billing.

This will increase your azure cost. Read up on how much on your own.

Organization Settings -> Billing

Under "Self-Hosted CI/CD" set "Paid parallel jobs" = 3
