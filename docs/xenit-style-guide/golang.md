Golang (Go) is one of the most common languages at Xenit especially for backend systems and open source projects. It should be the first language choice when starting a new project.

## HTTP

Go has a standard library which includes an HTTP server, but it usually does not fulfill all requirements. For this reason the preferred HTTP library to be used at Xenit is [go-gin](https://github.com/gin-gonic/gin). It provides certain extensions such as path parameters and middleware which developers are accustomed to in other programming languages.
