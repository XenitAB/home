Welcome to Xenit's open source projects!

We at Xenit are strong believers in open source, we feel that we have gotten so much from open source
and we try to give as much back as possible of our daily work.

This page hosts our general documentation but we also store documentation close to our source code
and can give you extra needed context.

Here are a few of our projects.

- [Terraform-modules](https://github.com/xenitab/terraform-modules) stores all our Terraform code and the base for XKF.
- [azure-devops-templates](https://github.com/XenitAB/azure-devops-templates) contains both GitHub and Azure DevOps templates for our CI/CD solution.
- [azad-kube-proxy](https://github.com/XenitAB/azad-kube-proxy) a auth proxy for kubernetes used in XKF.
- [gitops-promotion](https://github.com/XenitAB/gitops-promotion) instead of writing complex shell scripts to auto update our Gitops repositories we have built a small Go application to help us.
- [git-auth-proxy](https://github.com/XenitAB/git-auth-proxy) Proxy to allow multi tenant sharing of GitHub and Azure DevOps credentials in Kubernetes.
- [github-actions](https://github.com/XenitAB/github-actions) A Go application to automatically prepare Terraform state management and a container image to run in Terraform pipelines.

We have many more open source projects so feel free to look around in [https://github.com/XenitAB](https://github.com/XenitAB).
