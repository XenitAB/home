As a XKS 2.0 customer you are getting monthly reports, these reports exist to help to get a quick overview
of your environment and how your platform is doing.

## Security

Xenit **isn't** responsible for the security of your application but a part of the report we point to
the number of CVE:s in your applications found by our automated scanning tools that we have in XKF.

This is a extra way for at Xenit to help you as a developer but you **can't** rely on Xenit to point out specific security flaws in your application. Security is something that **you and your company** is in charge of we are just trying to visualize some of the data that we have access to.

As a part of XKF we continuously scan all images running in our clusters. To do this we depend on
[starboard](https://github.com/aquasecurity/starboard/) together with [trivy](https://github.com/aquasecurity/trivy/).

If you are using the Xenit CI solution you are by default scanning your container images with Trivy at creation time.
But new CVE:s might have come out since you created your image and that is why continuous scanning of images is important.

### Vulnerability reports

From the report you will get an overview of how many CVE:s and the different severity of CVE:s that you currently have.
But it doesn't give you specific information about the CVE.

To get specific data about your container image you need to login in to the kubernetes cluster and look.

To view all the vulnerability reports that you have in current namespace:

```shell
kubectl get vulnerabilityreports
```

To get a specific vulnerabilityreport just run a describe on the object in current namespace.

```shell
kubectl describe vulnerabilityreports.aquasecurity.github.io <the-specific-report>
```

For more specific questions around starboard we recommend reading the [official documentation](https://aquasecurity.github.io/starboard/latest/faq).

### Config audit reports

You can also look at configauditreports, is generated by starboard using [polaris](https://github.com/FairwindsOps/polaris).
Polaris provides a number of best practices on how to configure your kubernetes pods,
both from a security point of view but also setting things like memory limits.

```shell
kubectl get configauditreports.aquasecurity.github.io
```

To get a specific configauditreports just run a describe on the object in current namespace.

```shell
kubectl describe configauditreports.aquasecurity.github.io <the-specific-report>
```
