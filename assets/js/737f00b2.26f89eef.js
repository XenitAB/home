We normally break this down into logging, metrics, tracing and audit trails. The relative merit of these differ greatly between apps, but all apps should have an observability strategy. Often, the need changes as an app evolve: early in the lifecycle, logging may dominate, but as usage grows, focus shifts to metrics.

These are based on interpreted languages where it is relatively easy to give scripting or interactive access to the app's internals: the main reason is to ensure that database access occurs using the same models that are used during runtime.

First, that tools used to administer an app should be versioned and released with the same discipline as your app is.
